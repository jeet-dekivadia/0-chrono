Hypoglycemia can cause confusion, seizures, or loss of consciousness if not corrected promptly. Immediate administration of 15–20 g dextrose (e.g., 50 % glucose solution) is recommended, followed by a repeat glucose measurement to confirm resolution.",

A value of 15 mEq/L is critically high and indicates hyperkalemia, which can precipitate life‑threatening cardiac arrhythmias.

If the intended value were 18 mEq/L, that would represent severe hyponatremia (normal 135–145 mEq/L), which can cause seizures, confusion, and coma.

## A hackMIT Story of Reimagining Healthcare

> **YC Challenge Submission**: What if DrChrono were founded today with AI at its core?

## The Story

It was 3 AM at hackMIT when Jeet Dekivadia, Revanth Reddy, Pratham Pill, and Samuel Wang huddled around their laptops in the corner of Stata Center, surrounded by empty energy drink cans and the glow of multiple monitors. They had been wrestling with a problem that had been bothering them for months: why was healthcare technology still stuck in 2009? Jeet, who had shadowed doctors during his pre-med track, kept talking about how physicians spent more time fighting with clunky EHR systems than actually treating patients. "DrChrono was revolutionary when it launched," he said, pulling up the company's Wikipedia page, "but that was 2009. Before ChatGPT, before modern AI, before everything we take for granted today." The team realized they had stumbled upon the perfect YC challenge opportunity‚Äîwhat if they could rebuild DrChrono from scratch, but as if it were born in 2025 with AI in its DNA?

The breakthrough came when Samuel, exhausted from clicking through endless medical forms during his research, muttered "I wish I could just tell this thing what to do." That's when it clicked. While DrChrono had digitized paper workflows, they were still fundamentally the same workflows‚Äîdoctors adapting to software instead of software adapting to doctors. The team envisioned something radically different: a medical platform that understood natural language, anticipated physician needs, and learned from every interaction. "What if," Revanth proposed while sketching on a whiteboard, "instead of making doctors learn our interface, we make our interface learn how doctors think?" They decided to build 0chrono‚Äînot just another EHR, but an AI-native medical assistant that would make healthcare feel as natural as having a conversation with a brilliant colleague who never forgets anything and is available 24/7.

The technical architecture they designed was as ambitious as their vision. Pratham, the team's full-stack expert, insisted on building with Next.js 15 and TypeScript for the frontend, while Jeet championed Supabase for real-time data synchronization‚Äîcrucial for a medical environment where information changes constantly. But the real magic happened when they integrated Cerebras for ultra-fast AI inference, enabling real-time voice command processing that could understand complex medical terminology and context. Samuel worked on the Web Speech API integration while Revanth built the intelligent review workflows that could automatically prioritize critical commands, flag potential medication conflicts, and batch related tasks for efficient processing. The result was a system where a doctor could simply say "Schedule John Doe for next Tuesday at 2 PM for his diabetes follow-up" and watch as the AI not only created the appointment but also pulled up his recent lab results, flagged his overdue prescription refill, and suggested optimal timing based on the doctor's historical patterns.

What made 0chrono truly revolutionary wasn't just the voice interface‚Äîit was the AI's ability to think like a physician. The system they built could analyze patient data in real-time, identifying high-risk patients before problems escalated, suggesting treatment modifications based on the latest research, and even optimizing clinic schedules to improve patient flow. Unlike DrChrono's static reports and manual processes, 0chrono provided predictive insights that evolved with each interaction. The AI learned that Dr. Smith preferred morning appointments for elderly patients, that certain medication combinations required extra attention, and that follow-up reminders should be sent at specific intervals for maximum effectiveness. During their demo preparation, they realized they had created something that felt less like software and more like an intelligent medical partner‚Äîone that could process vast amounts of data instantly while maintaining the human touch that healthcare desperately needed.

As the hackMIT deadline approached, the team reflected on what they had built in just 36 hours. They had created a fully functional medical platform with voice-driven workflows, real-time AI analytics, intelligent patient visualization, and predictive healthcare insights. But more importantly, they had proven a fundamental thesis: that the future of medical technology wasn't about digitizing existing processes, but about reimagining them entirely through the lens of artificial intelligence. DrChrono had been revolutionary for its time, transforming paper-based practices into digital workflows. But 0chrono represented the next evolution‚Äîtransforming digital workflows into intelligent conversations. As Jeet submitted their final demo link and the team prepared for their presentation, they knew they weren't just competing in a hackathon; they were proposing a fundamental shift in how healthcare technology should work in the age of AI.

The market opportunity was staggering. DrChrono, with its 100,000+ healthcare providers and estimated $500M valuation, had proven the demand for better medical practice management. But their growth was slowing, constrained by legacy architecture that couldn't adapt to modern AI capabilities. 0chrono's AI-native approach offered 10x efficiency gains through voice automation, predictive insights that could improve patient outcomes by 25%, and a natural interface that could reduce physician burnout‚Äîthe holy grail of healthcare technology. The team had built more than just a product; they had created a glimpse into the future of medicine, where artificial intelligence amplifies human expertise rather than replacing it, where technology adapts to physicians rather than the other way around, and where the focus returns to what matters most: providing exceptional patient care.
